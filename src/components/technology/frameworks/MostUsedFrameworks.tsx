                            TypeScript-based JavaScript framework. A substantial shift occurred in 2016 on the release
                            of
                            Angular 2. The latest stable version is Angular 11, which was released in November 2020.</p>

                            developed by ex-Google employee Evan You in 2014. Over the last three years, Vue has seen a
                            substantial shift in popularity,
                            even though it doesnâ€™t have the backing of a large company. The current stable version is

                            products (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp). The current stable version is 17.X, released

                            October 2020 (with smaller incremental updates since then).</p>

                <p>According to the survey results, each of the developers that responded have used React.js, Vue.js or
                    Angular to build web
                    applications with React being the most commonly used. This can be attributed to the fact that
                    when <a
                        href="https://andela.com" target="_blank" className="orange">Andela</a> was still running
                    bootcamps
                    in Uganda, their technology stack included React (and MongoDb, Express, NodeJs). This is consistent
                    with

                <p>
                    For building websites, Wordpress takes the lion's share with over 40% of the respondents
                    reporting that they have used it to build a website. The uptake of Drupal is still very low while
                    Django continues
                    to grow with nearly 37% of the developers saying that they have used it.
