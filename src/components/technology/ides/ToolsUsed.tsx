                <p>The most effective way to maximize the productivity of your development team is to use collaboration
                    tools. Software developers these days are not expected to work full-time without even contacting or
                    communicating with each other for long. If there is no collaboration among the workers, your
                    million-dollar worth of a product cannot sustain since itâ€™s been developed in a
                    communication-restrictive environment.</p>
                <p>Sharing ideas and suggestions, free communication and quick meet-ups to discuss even the smallest
                    detail, are the major factors behind the success of a software product. In order to ensure seamless,
                    effective and productive communication between project managers, their team members, and other
                    subordinates, organizations are adopting different collaboration tools.</p>
                <p>We asked the respondents which tools they use most to collaborate when working on a team and nearly
                    all of them said that they use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"

                                                                                        target="_blank"
                                                                                        className="orange">Slack</a> is
                    also a favorite for developers especially for meetings, instant messages and sharing code snippets.
